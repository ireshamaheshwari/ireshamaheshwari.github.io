This unique course at IIIT Kota is aimed to allow students to explore their creative dimension by one
Independent Project in the first year. This is an unstructured open-ended course where under the
overall supervision of course coordinators, batches of students will be attached to different instructors.
The basic aim of this course is to arise creative thinking and impart skills among students, and make
them work as a team to implement their own constructive and challenging ideas. At end of the course,
each team needs to present their idea in the form of a product and submit a project report as a
culmination of their endeavor and investigation.
